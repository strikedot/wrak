My life returned to normal, that's a long time ago. The truth is that I don't really know why I never wished before to be a Pokémon. No, I never wish to be a human again. And I missed my dear grass-type friend and partner that had travels with me trough the time to fix the world, to have a better future, who in that future us will never exist. Oh wow, each time I think of all that, it's like if I would never know who I am again. Is my choices definites? And my family, I didn't forget, had I a family? No, now I'm alone.<br/><ind />
	I shouldn't be sad today, I shouldn't have too dark thoughts. It's Deeza's birthday, and I should be here, like totally here in my head for her too, she's now 15. I will store my self-questions for later.<br/><ind />
	I'm on the stairs, and in my left this is the door of Tally's room. In the second where my eyes slowly looks at the door, the door opened.<br/><ind />
	<br/><ind />
	? (far): "Is Deeza wake up already?"<br/><ind />
	Me (tired): "I don't know. If she's sleeping, we shouldn't wake her. Àpropos of yesterday, I'm sorry to have come back too late."<br/><ind />
	? (far): "It's nothing. You don't have to apologize. Just... Deeza's friends are waiting for her."<br/><ind />
	Me: "Um... Tally... Instead of almost shouting, can you go to your door, it's difficult for me to have a conversation like that."<br/><ind />
	?→Tally (far): "Okay, next time I'll do that."<br/><ind />
	Me (smiling a little): "Do you just say "next time"?"<br/><ind />
	Tally (going close): "It's because this time I have finished my shoes."<br/><ind />
	<br/><ind />
	Tally is a shiny Shinx. He and I were friends and roommate since when our adventure begin, when he found me on the edge of the water.<br/><ind />
	<br/><ind />
	Me: "Not again your shoes? I tell you many times to don't matter about the thing that strangers thinks that you're still a child. I will tell them–"<br/><ind />
	Tally: "But each time they say: "Oh sorry, I mean he's a guy, how old are you?" or sorta thing like that."<br/><ind />
	<br/><ind />
	Tally, since our third city move, is tired to be calling "boy". It's the cons to have an Everstone. The pros, in his opinion, is to be more energetic.In this case, Tally made weird shoes that change his appearance temporarily.<br/><ind />
	Come to think of it, what appearance?<br/><ind />
	<br/><ind />
	Tally: "I know you're miles away, Atiiee. I will wake Deeza."<br/><ind />
	Me: "Suit yourself then. It's you choice. I'll make breakfast."<br/><ind />
	<br/><ind />
	He hadn't heard my last sentence, since he's already gone.<br/><ind />
	<br/>
What have we in the fridge? Out of eggs. But school begin tomorrow. Is it because Tally had an hunger rage Saturday?<br/><ind />
	?: "Good morning."<br/><ind />
	Me: "From who this is the brithday? I think this is your birthday!"<br/><ind />
	<br/><ind />
	My right paw point to one of many big ballons that I have put in the living room. The house have no door between the dining and the living room. I knew this were Deeza, I heard little sparkles. It's normal to be exited in our birthday. Deeza is an Jolteon, but her evolved form appeared from not so long.<br/><ind />
	?→Deeza: "Oh, thanks."<br/><ind />
	Me (curious): "I've heard from Tally that you're friends are waiting for you. What's happening so soon in the morning?"<br/><ind />
